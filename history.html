      <h1>Early Developments</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Invention of the Internal Combustion Engine</h2>
        <h3>Otto's Four-Stroke Engine</h3>
        <p>
          The history of combustion car engines began in the late 19th century
          with the invention of the internal combustion engine.
          <em>Nikolaus Otto's</em> development of the four-stroke engine in
          <strong>1876</strong> laid the foundation for modern engine designs.
          It featured the intake, compression, power, and exhaust strokes, which
          remain a fundamental concept in engine operation.
        </p>
        <h3>Daimler and the First Motorcycles</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Gottlieb Daimler</em> and <em>Wilhelm Maybach</em> also made
          significant contributions. They developed lightweight and high-speed
          internal combustion engines suitable for powering the first
          motorcycles and early automobiles.
        </p>
        <h2>First Practical Automobiles</h2>
        <h3>Benz Patent-Motorwagen</h3>
        <p>
          In <strong>1885-1886</strong>, <em>Karl Benz</em> built the Benz
          Patent-Motorwagen, which is widely recognized as the first true
          gasoline-powered car. It featured a single-cylinder internal
          combustion engine, and its design marked the beginning of the
          automotive industry.

      <h1>Advancements in the 20th Century</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Mass Production and the Model T</h2>
        <h3>Ford's Assembly Line Revolution</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Henry Ford's</em> introduction of the assembly line and mass
          production techniques in the early 20th century transformed the
          automobile industry. The Ford Model T, produced from
          <strong>1908</strong> to <strong>1927</strong>, became the first car
          that many people could afford, thanks to the efficiency of the
          assembly line.
        </p>
        <h3>V-8 Engines and Power</h3>
        <p>
          In the <strong>1930s</strong>, the development of V-8 engines and
          other innovations in engine design led to increased power and
          performance in automobiles.
        </p>
        <h2>Modern Fuel Injection Systems</h2>
        <h3>Transition from Carburetors</h3>
        <p>
          During the mid-20th century, there was a significant shift from
          carburetors to modern fuel injection systems. Fuel injection improved
          fuel efficiency and reduced emissions, marking a crucial advancement
          in engine technology.
        </p>
        <h3>Electronic Engine Control</h3>
        <p>
          Electronic engine control systems, introduced in the late 20th
          century, allowed for precise control of fuel injection and ignition
          timing, further improving engine performance and reducing emissions.
