                  The Benz Patent-Motorwagen is widely regarded as the first
                  true gasoline-powered automobile. It featured a
                  single-cylinder internal combustion engine, three wheels, and
                  a top speed of 16 km/h (10 mph).

            Ford was born on a farm in Michigan's Springwells Township, leaving
            home at age 16 to work in Detroit. It was a few years before this
            time that Ford first experienced automobiles, and throughout the
            later half of the 1880s, Ford began repairing and later constructing
            engines, and through the 1890s worked with a division of Edison
            Electric. He officially founded Ford Motor Company in 1903, after
            prior failures in business but success in constructing automobiles.

                The Diesel Engine (1892): Rudolf Diesel is best known for
                inventing the diesel engine in 1892. This engine operates on the
                principle of compression ignition, where high compression ratios
                ignite the fuel-air mixture without the need for a spark plug.
              </li>
              <li>
                Injector Nozzle: Diesel also developed the injector nozzle, a
                crucial component of the diesel engine. The injector nozzle
                precisely sprays and injects fuel into the combustion chamber,
                enabling efficient and controlled combustion.
              </li>
              <li>
                Thermodynamic Cycle: Diesel's work included the development of
                the thermodynamic cycle that underpins the operation of diesel
                engines. This cycle describes the processes of air compression,
                fuel injection, combustion, and exhaust.
              </li>
              <li>
                Other Innovations: Throughout his career, Diesel made various
                contributions to engineering and thermodynamics. He continued to
                refine and improve his engine design, making it more efficient
                and applicable to a range of industries.

            Daimler and his lifelong business partner Wilhelm Maybach were two
            inventors whose goal was to create small, high-speed engines to be
            mounted in any kind of locomotion device. In 1883 they designed a
            horizontal cylinder layout compressed charge liquid petroleum engine
            that fulfilled Daimler's desire for a high speed engine which could
            be throttled, making it useful in transportation applications. This
            engine was called Daimler's Dream.

            During the 1890s he was hailed in France, then the world centre for
            car production, as the "King of Designers". From the late 19th
            century Wilhelm Maybach, together with Gottlieb Daimler, developed
            light, high-speed internal combustion engines suitable for land,
            water, and air use. These were fitted to the world's first
            motorcycle, motorboat, and after Daimler's death, a new automobile
            introduced in late 1902, the Mercedes model, built to the
            specifications of Emil Jellinek.
