      <h2>Internal Combustion Engine</h2>
      <p>
        An internal combustion engine is the primary power source for most cars.
        Specifically, an internal-combustion engine is a heat engine in that it
        converts energy from the heat of burning gasoline into mechanical work,
        or torque. That torque is applied to the wheels to make the car move.
        And unless you are driving an ancient two-stroke Saab (which sounds like
        an old chain saw and belches oily smoke out its exhaust), your engine
        works on the same basic principles whether you're wheeling a Ford or a
        Ferrari.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engines have pistons that move up and down inside metal tubes called
        cylinders. Imagine riding a bicycle: Your legs move up and down to turn
        the pedals. Pistons are connected via rods (they're like your shins) to
        a crankshaft, and they move up and down to spin the engine's crankshaft,
        the same way your legs spin the bike'sâ€”which in turn powers the bike's
        drive wheel or car's drive wheels. Depending on the vehicle, there are
        typically between two and 12 cylinders in its engine, with a piston
        moving up and down in each.
      </p>

      <h3>Components of an Internal Combustion Engine</h3>
      <p>Key parts that make up the engine:</p>

      <h4>1. Engine Block</h4>
      <p>The engine block is the main structural component of the engine.</p>

      <h4>2. Cylinder Head</h4>
      <p>
        The cylinder head covers the top of the engine block and contains the
        combustion chambers.
      </p>

      <h5>a. Valves</h5>
      <p>
        The cylinder head contains intake and exhaust valves that control the
        flow of air and exhaust gases.
      </p>

      <h5>b. Camshaft</h5>
      <p>
        The camshaft is responsible for opening and closing the engine's valves
        at the right times.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Pistons and Connecting Rods</h4>
      <p>
        Pistons move up and down within the cylinders, connected to the
        crankshaft by connecting rods.
      </p>

      <h5>a. Piston Rings</h5>
      <p>
        Piston rings provide a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall to
        contain combustion gases.
      </p>

      <h5>b. Crankshaft</h5>
      <p>
        The crankshaft converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational
        motion to drive the vehicle.
      </p>

      <h3>Types of Internal Combustion Engines</h3>
      <p>There are different types of internal combustion engines:</p>

      <h4>a. Spark Ignition Engines</h4>
      <p>These engines ignite the fuel-air mixture using spark plugs.</p>
      <details>
        <summary>Spark plugs</summary>
        <p>
          A spark plug supplies a small electrical spark. It ignites the fuel
          inside the combustion chamber at a precise moment, which pushes the
          cylinder down and then moves the car forward.
        </p>
      </details>
      <h4>b. Compression Ignition Engines</h4>
      <p>
        These engines compress the air in the cylinder until it heats up and
        ignites the fuel without a spark plug.
      </p>
      <details>
        <summary>Compression action</summary>
        <p>
          The engine uses a higher compression ratio than a spark ignition
          engine to heat air in the engine cylinder
        </p>
      </details>
      <h3>Engine Operation</h3>
      <p>Understanding how an engine works:</p>

      <h4>1. Air Intake</h4>
      <p>The engine draws in air through the intake manifold.</p>

      <h4>2. Fuel Injection/Ignition</h4>
      <p>Fuel is injected and ignited to create power in the cylinders.</p>

      <h4>3. Combustion and Exhaust</h4>
      <p>
        The air-fuel mixture combusts, and exhaust gases exit through the
        exhaust system.
